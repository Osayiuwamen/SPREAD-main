        That's Entertainment!:
        Graphic Design in the Neoliberal Era
      </p>
      <article>
        <p>
          Graphic design culture at large has the potential to be intellectual and critical in nature, yet the
          individuals
          and
          groups that operate within the sphere of cultural production and assorted economies attached to graphic design
          consistently ignore intellectualism as operational methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exhibition is the opposite—within, I attempt to suggest some of the difficulties that both the public and
          design
          practitioners are facing with the development of design in the Neoliberal Era.

          Most of the formal and aesthetic attributes of the new Global Style
          are lifted directly from the International Style. White space backgrounds, sans serif typefaces, minimalist
          asymmetrically balanced compositions with limited
          color palette.

        </p>

          No extraneous decoration, ornament or complex patters, A love of simple geometric shapes. The one notable
          exception is
          the grid.It’s not that the grid is no longer there—it’s that the grid is no longer visible or even detectable.

          It is embedded in the 0’s and 1’s and x and y coordinates of digital space… just like the movie Tron, the
          digital
          environment is built on a grid (it just doesn’t glow like neon).

          Encircled by the polyphonic ‘mist’ of the posters is an on-demand replica of the Free Speech Monument erected
          at the
          University of California, Berkeley—a physical celebration and memorial to the Free Speech movement there. It
          reads:
        </p>
        <p>
          “THIS SOIL AND THE AIR SPACE EXTENDING ABOVE IT SHALL NOT BE A PART OF ANY NATION AND SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO
          ANY
          ENTITY’S JURISDICTION.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The original monument, Mark Brest van Kempen’s “Column of Earth and Air”, has no legal bearing—it is merely a
          monument
          to the notion of free speech and is not a true autonomous zone.

          Economist Tyler Cowen wrote in his 2009 book Creative Destruction: How Globalization Is Changing the World's
          Cultures
          that:

          Critics and experts tend to be most effective when the evaluated item is large in value, relative to the
          effort required
          to assess it. Experts are hired to assess the quality of diamonds, but not the quality of brass.

          We buy Consumer Reports to evaluate new cars or stereos on the market, but not new brands of thumbtacks or
          paper clips.

        <p>The role of the critic in contemporary society, especially in terms of graphic design, is shifting in that
          the perceived
          value of design seems to be increasing socially, whereas the economic value of design is increasingly
          atomized,
          fragmented, compartmentalized and destabilized.</p>
